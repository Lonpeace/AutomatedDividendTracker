# Simple Dividend Tracker

Hello, this is my attempt at creating a dividend tracker with MS Excel, Python and xlwings, tailored for a specific kind of dividend traders.

If you are a person who rarely buy or sell any new stocks, and is fustrated with the need to manually key in a dividend entry everytime it pops up, then this project might just be able to help you. 

For this application to run, you would need to have installed Python (3.11.1), xlwings, MS Excel, yfinance and pandas. (Versions shown in requirements.txt)

For the Portfolio sheet, lets call it the main sheet, only the column "Miscellaneous Fees" has to be keyed in manually. And if your stock has been delisted on Yahoo Finance, like "Mapletree NAC Tr" that is shown below, its dividends will have to be keyed in manually too. :(

Sadly, for the buy and sell transactions, you would still have to manually key in the values. If you buy a new stock, make sure to update the 2nd table in the main sheet.
